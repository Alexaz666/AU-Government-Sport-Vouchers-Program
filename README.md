### Federal Government Sport Vouchers Program Analysis

This is a project for unit COMP6200 that I took as part of my postgraduate study in Business Analytics at Macquarie Univeristy.

This project involves data from the Federal Government Sport Vouchers program - this is a program that provides up to two $100 vouchers for kids to participate in organised sport. This project focuses on data from South Australia. 

The source data comes from the data.gov.au website and provides details of all Sport Vouchers that have been redeemed since February in SA 2015 as part of the Sport Voucher program (files/sportsvouchersclaimed.csv).

To augment this data, ABS SEIFA data by LGA is integrated (files/ABS_SEIFA_LGA.csv), which shows a few measures of Socioeconomic Advantage and Disadvantage for every Local Government Area. This helps answer questions about whether the voucher program is used equally by parents in low, middle and high socioeconomic areas, for example, if this kind of program might just benifit parents who are already advantaged (they might already be paying for sport so this program wouldn't be helping much).

Specific questions answered in this analysis are:
1. Describe the distribution of vouchers by: LGA, Sport - which regions/sports stand out?
2. Are some sports more popular in different parts of the state?
3. Are any electorates over/under represented in their use of vouchers?
4. Is there a relationship between any of the SEIFA measures and voucher use in an LGA?
